### Why Jekyll JAM
Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. Jekyll renders Markdown and Liquid
templates and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served as static files based
web site, light, fast and secure.

Jekyll is so :cool:, if you have some techie background. If not, it's not very friendly.
Jekyll JAM comes to fill this gap and allow users to build their own web for free, without
software installation, domains and dns configuration neither hosting plans.

### How to use it?
Create a new project with [https://codeccoop.org/jekyll-jam](CÃ²dec) or with any other Jekyll JAM
provider you know. At your first time in the editor, Jekyll JAM will require you to configure the
project. It will take you throughout a process to syncronize your project with GitHub and define
wich deployment mode you want tu use and what Jekyll Theme you want to use for your brand new site.

### Deployment modes
#### GitHub page
GitHub offers their GitHub pages as a free service to publish your repository content on the web.
GitHub pages is running on top of Jekyll to compile your code and get a complete web site. With
GitHub Pages you can host your page for free on GitHub, using their domain, or bind your page to
a domain of your own and get it on the web without traces of GitHub.

#### FTP hosting
With GitHub Workflows, we can compile the Jekyll templeates into a web page and then perform
a continious integration with your host using FTP. If you prefer to own your own host and domain
and use Jekyll JAM as your CMS, this is your option.

#### Arhive File
Use Jekyll JAM as a content editor, GitHub as a compile environment, and get the result compressed
as a zip file to make what you want with it.
